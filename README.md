#DESCRIPTION:
This project was developed as part of CodTech Internship Task-1, where I implemented a basic Decision Tree Classifier using Python. The objective was to understand how decision trees work in machine learning and to practically apply them on a classification problem using a real-world dataset.
This project was developed as part of CodTech Internship Task-1, where I implemented a basic Decision Tree Classifier using Python. The objective was to understand how decision trees work in machine learning and to practically apply them on a classification problem using a real-world dataset.The dataset used in this project is the Iris dataset, a popular dataset in machine learning. It contains various measurements of iris flowers, including sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Based on these features, the goal is to predict the species of the flower.

ðŸ”§ Tools and Libraries Used
Python

scikit-learn for machine learning model and dataset handling

pandas for data manipulation

matplotlib for optional plotting
The model successfully learned patterns from the training data and predicted the test data results effectively. I also compared the actual and predicted labels to validate the model's accuracy manually. The output clearly showed that the decision tree was able to classify the flower species based on input features.
Conclusion
This task gave me hands-on experience in implementing a supervised machine learning algorithm from scratch using Python. It helped me understand the core concepts of decision trees and how they are applied in solving classification problems. The project also improved my skills in data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
